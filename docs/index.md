Industrial Data Engineering and Extended Reality

## About this portfolio

This website presents my individual technical contributions to an industrial extended reality project developed during the HT2025 course. The project was a team effort, and the main source code repository is hosted under a teammate’s GitHub account.

It focuses on my responsibilities and deliverables, and provides a structured view of my work, supported by screenshots and gifs.
A detailed sprint-based log of my individual contributions is available in the Individual contribution log.


## Project context

The project integrates Siemens PLCs, OPC UA, Node RED, REST APIs, Unity, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 to demonstrate real time industrial data visualization in an XR environment.

## My role in the project

• Project leadership and coordination during sprints  
• Level 1 connectivity and OPC UA communication validation  
• Node RED flow design and implementation  
• REST API design for Unity consumption  
• Data aggregation into single station based JSON endpoints
• Tests for communication, debugging and deployment on Hololens2

My individual contributions are traceable in a dedicated branch of the team repository, referenced in the Version control and collaboration section.
